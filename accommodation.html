            Looking for accommodation can be stressful and time consuming but when you have to look for a place to live
            in another country, the pressure is even greater!
            To make this process easier for you we have put together some information and tips that you can use when
            looking for accommodation on your year abroad.
        <h2 id="H2accommodation">Where to live</h2>
        <p id="paccommodation">
            France is used to foreign students so you will have no trouble finding accommodation, however, it is
            important to know where to live. Most students will got to Paris and,
            as any other big city, you need to be caureful of certain places.
            <br> This table shows how safe each arrondissement is:
        </p>
        <table id="T1table" style="width:40%">
            <tr id="T1tr">
                <th>Safe</th>

                <td>16</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p id="paccommodation">You can use this table as a starting point on where to look for accommodation if you are going to Paris.
            The best arrondissements for students are 3, 4, 5 and 6; they are very vibrant and full of students.
            There are also plenty of shops, restaurants and bars so you won't lack of social life! However, you need to take into account that arrondissements
            1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 16 are the more expensive. 
            <br> If you are going to another French city make sure you take into account which areas are more dangerous
            than
            others, remember that you will have to live there for many months!
        </p>
        <h2 id="H2accommodation">Types of accommodation</h2>
        <dl>
            <dt>Foyers</dt>
            <dd>They are one of the cheapest options. The rent includes utility bills, Internet and liability insurance;
                some foyers even offer half-board, this means that they will provide breakfast and dinner on weekdays!
                This type of accommodation is aimed at students and trainees so many offer group activities for you to
                meet others that live there.
                <br>However, a low price comes with disadvanatges. There is a lack of privacy since the bathrooms and
                kitchen are shared.
                In addition to this, many foyers don't allow guests for safety reasons so having friends over is not an
                option.
                <br> If you want to have a look at some of the foyers located in Paris <a
                    href="https://www.cljt.com/index.php/en" target="_blank">click here</a>.
            </dd>
            <dt>Chambre de bonne</dt>
            <dd>This used to be the maid's quarters of apartments but over the years it has been remodeled to very small
                studio apartments and when I say very small, it is not an exaggeration.
                These studios are located on the top floor and there is rarely a lift but on a positive side, it is a
                great way of exercising! Another advantage is its location, many chambre de bonne are
                located in the city centre or very near it and the rent is not too high so if you want to live next to
                the Eiffle Tower and space is not your concern , this might be your best option.
                <br>To be honest, this type of accommodation really depends on the person's preferences but I would
                definetly have a look at some of them. You will be surprise by the range of chambre de bonne that there
                are!
            </dd>
            <dt>Shared accommodation</dt>
            <dd>One of the most popular options, mostly because students are more used to it. Many of you have shared a
                flat/house in your second year so you have a good idea of what mistakes not to make.
                <br>There are many advantages to sharing an appartment. First, the rooms tend to be big so you will have
                plenty of space and, since you can definetly have guests, a big room is a plus when inviting friends
                over.
                Also, if any of your friends are also going to France, you can rent and appartmenet with them! or if
                what you want is to meet new people, just look for a room.
                There are plenty of websites aimed at students and trainees that are looking for a room. You can go to
                <a href="https://www.appartager.com/" target="_blank">Appartager</a>, <a href="https://www.lodgis.com/"
                    target="_blank">Lodgis</a>, <a href="http://www.centralparisrentals.com/" target="_blank">Central Paris Rentals</a> 
                    or <a href="https://www.seloger.com/location.htm#?BD=Head_LO_1" target="_blank">SeLoger</a> just to name a few.
                <br>Sharing an appartment in a big city like Paris can be expensive, in addition to this, some
                landlords/agencies are not very friendly and can take weeks to fix a problem. Also, if you are sharing
                with a stranger there is the possibility of not getting along.
            </dd>
            <dt>Studio</dt>
            <dd>Finally, you can live in a studio (not to confused with chambre de bonne). This is the more expensive
                option but you will have plenty of privacy and freedom. You can find different sizes and many come
                furnished (meublé). However, it can get lonely and a good studio in the city centre won't be less that a
                €1,000 a month.
                Also, you can have an unfriendly landlord/agency.
